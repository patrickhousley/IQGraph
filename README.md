# IQ Graphing <TI-83 Plus Basic App>
This is an old basic application I wrote for my TI-83 Plus while I was in high
school. The purpose of this application is to take a quadratic equation of the
below forms and graph it. As an added bonus, it also shades the graph.

```
Y = Ax<sup>2</sup> + Bx + C
Y = A(x + B)<sup>2</sup> + C
```

The original release of the soure code can be found [here](http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/authors/75/7531.html).
